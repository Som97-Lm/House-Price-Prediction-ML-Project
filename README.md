##  Project Overview

The objective of this project is to predict **house prices** using a structured dataset containing numerical, categorical, and engineered features.

This is a practical ML workflow demonstrating:
- Data cleaning  
- Missing value treatment  
- Outlier detection  
- Feature engineering  
- Variable encoding  
- Skewness correction  
- Feature selection  
- Preparing the final modeling dataset
- Modeling
- Testing the model

This structure reflects industry best practices for building accurate regression models.

##  Dataset Description

The dataset includes:
- **Numerical features**: area, square footage, year built, basement size, garage area, etc.  
- **Categorical features**: neighborhood, exterior quality, building type, heating/cooling type, and more  
- **Target variable**: **SalePrice**

Dataset is similar to the Kaggle *House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques* competition.
